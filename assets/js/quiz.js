//make the timer function
//make an array1 of array2s with each array1 being a question containing an array2 of awnsers, one of which reads false.
//for loop the array1 through display on click
//generate a value for the return buttons depending on the true value of the array2
//onclick for the wrong value deducts time function, flashes error, goes to next array1
//onclick for the right value goes to next item in array1
//onclick to last array1 saves time as score.

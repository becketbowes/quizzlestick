# quizzlestick 1.0

This is the MVP of quizzlestick, a quiz applet that allows the user to run through a series quiz questions and enter their initials to save their score.

The game structure runs almost entirely through javascript, using minimal html and css. The questions are structures as objects assigned by an object array that is then looped through by the event listener, and is meant to be future scalable for other quizzes and questions.

Future iterations of the game will have a proper loop to reset the game and an internal game score organizer so that only the top five high scores would be saved, but i just tested positive for Covid so i just want to turn this in as is and watch some tv because i can't think so good.
